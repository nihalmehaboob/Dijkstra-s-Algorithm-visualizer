## Pathfinding Visualizer

This project was built based on my interest for learning pathfinding algorithms, and I decided I would do so by building a visualizer to help me better understand the concepts (currently: Dijkstra's Algorithm). Have fun discovering different paths!

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

A weighted pathfinding algorithm that, in this case, finds the shortest path between two nodes in a grid.
